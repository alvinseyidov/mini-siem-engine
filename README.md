# Mini SIEM Engine

A Python-based log analysis and correlation engine that simulates basic SIEM functionality.

This project demonstrates **detection logic and security monitoring**, not exploitation.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Log ingestion and normalization
- Event correlation
- Detection rules
- Security alerting logic
- Blue Team thinking

---

## Security Topics Covered

- Authentication log analysis
- Brute-force detection
- Suspicious IP behavior
- Pattern recognition
- Alert generation

---

## Core Features

- Ingest multiple log sources
- Detect suspicious authentication behavior
- Identify abnormal request patterns
- Simple rule-based detection engine
- Generate structured alerts

---

## Why This Project Exists

Security is not only about preventing attacks, but also about **detecting them**.
This project shows how defenders reason about logs and behavior.

---

## Intended Audience

- SOC Analysts
- Blue Team Engineers
- Security Engineers
- Detection-focused roles

---

## Disclaimer

This project is a learning simulation, not a production SIEM.
